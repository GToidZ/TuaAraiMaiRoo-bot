This bot is called **ตัวอะไรไม่รู้ but CPSK** (/tʰuaʔarajmajâ:ruːáːbʌtsiːpiːʔeːskʰeː/). It was originally a Discord bot created by [phusitsom](https://github.com/phusitsom). The bot is made for KU81 CPSK Discord Server.

**Note: This is not a refactor of the original TuaAraiMaiRoo, instead it is a recode built by using a newer Discord API wrapper that is constantly updating to support future features that Discord may provide.**
